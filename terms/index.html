												marketing using your affiliate URL or print. These methods are by which you may advertise on the Our behalf.
											</li>
											<li>
												Banners and links may not be placed within unsolicited e-mail, unauthorized postings, or chat rooms or by using “bots”. Traffic generated illegally will not be counted and may result in the
												termination of your account with us.
											</li>
											<li>We will terminate this agreement immediately if there is any form of spamming or if you discredit Us or our brands through false advertising, written or uttered words.</li>
											<li>You shall not make any claims, representations, or warranties in connection with us and you shall have no authority to and shall not bind us to any obligations.</li>
											<li>The appearance and syntax of the hypertext transfer links are designed and designated by us and constitute the only authorized and permitted representation of our sites.</li>
											<li>
												You will not knowingly benefit from known or suspected traffic not generated in good faith whether or not it actually causes damage. Should fraudulent activity arise through a person directed
												to a site via your link, we retain the right to retract the commissions paid to you at any time. Our decision in this regard will be final. We reserve the right to retain all amounts due to
												you under this Agreement if we have reasonable cause to believe that such traffic has been caused with your knowledge. Even if you have not knowingly generated such traffic, we reserve the
												right to withhold referral fees with respect to such traffic.
											</li>
											<li>
												Self-Referral: Affiliates are permitted to establish a player account with OceanBet and wager real money on any game offered. However, OceanBet policy prohibits affiliates
												from registering their player account under their own affiliate sheet. Commissions will be not paid out for their activity and the player account will be removed from their affiliate sheet. In
												this or any other manner, affiliates are restricted from earning commission from their own wagering.
											</li>
											<li>
												We do not tolerate spamming of any kind by our affiliate partners. If spamming by an affiliate is brought to our attention, he/she may be permanently banned from the OceanBet Partners
												Affiliate program. Under no circumstances may an affiliate send email blasts including a direct link back to any page on OceanBet using a direct reference to the brand as this is
												considered brand infringement (see T&amp;Cs). The only links permitted are those using the new encrypted token provided on the OceanBet Partners platform. (i.e.
												https://www.OceanBet.com?aff=0010).
											</li>
											<li>
												This Marketing opportunity is for commercial use only, and you may not sign up or make deposits to any Account, directly or indirectly, through your Tracker(s) for your own personal use, to
												fraudulently increase the Affiliate Fees payable to you or to otherwise defraud us. In no event are you to receive Affiliate Fees on your own Player Account. Violation of this provision
												constitutes Fraud Traffic.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Purchase Processing</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>You are only responsible for directing customers to <a href="http://www.OceanBet.com">www.OceanBet.com</a>.</li>
											<li>
												Only properly tagged customers can be assigned to an affiliate. Should an affiliate tag be improperly inserted into the affiliate site or not properly received by our web server the resulting
												customer registration and purchases will not be assigned to the affiliate. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the affiliate to ensure that all links are properly tagged.
											</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Revenue Sharing, Fees &amp; Payment</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>OceanBet Partners will pay out revenue share on the commission-able earnings generated by each customer, as defined by us.</li>
											<li>Commission-able earnings or (NGR) are calculated as Our profit, less charge-backs, complimentary money, free money offers and other incentives offered to the customer.</li>
											<li>
												Charge-back: A credit card holder discovers irregular transactions made on his/her Credit/Debit Card, which were not authorized by him/her. The credit card holder then requests his/her bank to
												reverse these charges. Charge backs relate to fraudulent use by a third party of the credit card holder’s card or card number.
											</li>
											<li>
												Should the player process a charge back, the disputed or charged-back revenue generated by yourself will be forfeited and therefore deducted from the total balance due to you for the current
												month.
											</li>
											<li>
												Should the above-mentioned deduction of the accumulated revenue exceed your current amount due, your balance will then revert to a negative balance, and you will have to earn revenue to cover
												the charge-back before you can start earning revenue again.
											</li>
											<li>OceanBet Partners may include processing and/or networking fees in commission calculations depending on the brand and payment method.</li>
											<li>A chargeback will stay due till the revenue generated by your other players has covered the amount due.</li>
											<li>Our products can only pay out a percentage of their profits, not fraudulent revenue.</li>
											<li>
												Complimentary Money, Free Money and Other incentives refer to those amounts credited to the account of customers. As they have not purchased these amounts, we cannot pay commissions on these
												amounts.
											</li>
											<li>Commission-able earnings will be subject to commissions as calculated using the tiered commission table:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>25% = 0 to 10 FTDs (First Time Depositors) per calendar month</li>
												<li>30% = 11 to 25 FTDs (First Time Depositors) per calendar month</li>
												<li>35% = 26 to 50 FTDs (First Time Depositors) per calendar month</li>
												<li>40% = 50+ FTDs (First Time Depositors) per calendar month</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Negative earnings are not carried forward to the next months. We have No Negative Carry over.</li>
											<li>
												The net revenue plan (25-40% net revenue) commission-able earnings will be earned for the life of the customer, on all transactions contributing to the affiliate’s monthly NGR, for as long as
												the affiliate remains a member of this affiliate program.
											</li>
											<li>
												Affiliates are paid commissions once per month. You will be paid within 30 days of month’s end, though every effort is made to pay by the 15
												<sup>th</sup>
												of every month. Payments are made by Bitcoin or Bank Wire. It is the responsibility of the affiliate to select the method of payment.
